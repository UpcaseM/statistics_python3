Use Python to solve statistics problems.

1. [Empirical Bayes](empirical_bayes)
Learn theory and practice behind empirical bayes, including computing credible intervals, performing Bayesian A/B testing, and fitting mixture models. Each example is accompanied with visualizations to demonstrate the mathematical concepts using Python3. [Reference](http://varianceexplained.org/r/bayesian_ab_baseball/)

2. [Statistics for Business](statistics_for_business)
